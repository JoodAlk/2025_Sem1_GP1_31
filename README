Smart Waste Monitoring and Collection System  

## Introduction  
**Baseer (بصير)** is a smart waste monitoring and collection system designed to optimize urban waste management in Riyadh.  
The device uses IoT-enabled ultrasonic sensors installed in trash bins to monitor fill levels in real time.  
Data is transmitted to a cloud-based platform, where collection truck drivers and administrators can access insights through a mobile application.  

- **Goal:** Increase efficiency of waste collection by reducing unnecessary trips, lowering operational costs, and ensuring cleaner streets.  
- **Benefits:** Faster collection, less overflow, reduced odors and pests, and improved decision-making using data.  

## Technology  
- **Programming:**  
  - Arduino IDE (ESP32 microcontroller)  
  - Flutter (mobile application for drivers/admins)  
- **Hardware:**  
  - ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth  
  - JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor (for bin fill-level)  
  - Breadboard, jumper wires, USB power module for prototyping  
- **Cloud & Database:**  
  - Firebase Realtime Database for data synchronization  
- **API:**  
  - Google Maps API for optimized routing  

## Launching Instructions  
1. **Hardware Setup:**  
   - Connect ESP32 microcontroller to JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor via breadboard and jumper wires.  
   - Upload ESP32 program using Arduino IDE.  

2. **Cloud Integration:**  
   - Configure Firebase Realtime Database.  
   - Ensure ESP32 sends sensor readings to Firebase.  

3. **Mobile App:**  
   - Clone the Flutter app code.  
   - Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.  
   - Launch app on Android/iOS with `flutter run`.  

4. **Usage:**  
   - **Drivers:** View bin fill levels and follow optimized routes.  
   - **Admins:** Monitor bin status city-wide and track collection activity.
